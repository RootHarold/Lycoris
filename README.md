# Lycoris
**Lycoris** is an open source software library for **Deep Learning**. The kernel is based on *Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies*. And unlike the mainstream network, it is driven by events.

The aim of Lycoris is to complete both the tasks of supervised learning and the tasks of reinforcement learning. At this stage, Lycoris enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs in most operating systems. **In the near future, GPUs will be added to the minimalist architecture**.
